This poses a safety hazard for children (e.g. falling, getting stuck in railing). Guardrails should not have gaps or voids that allow passage of a sphere equal to or greater than 4 inches in diameter, or 6 inches in diameter at triangular spaces between stair edges and guardrails. At a minimum, the client should be aware of this hazard. Recommend that a qualified contractor repair or replace guardrails per standard building practices.

Any comments made regarding these items are as a courtesy only. Note that the inspector does not determine the adequacy of grounding or bonding, if this system has an adequate capacity for the client's specific or anticipated needs, or if this system has any reserve capacity for additions or expansion. The inspector does not operate circuit breakers as part of the inspection, and does not install or change light bulbs. The inspector does not evaluate every wall switch or receptacle, but instead tests a representative number of them per various standards of practice. When furnishings, stored items or child-protective caps are present some receptacles are usually inaccessible and are not tested; these are excluded from this inspection. Receptacles that are not of standard 110 volt configuration, including 240-volt dryer receptacles, are not tested and are excluded. The functionality of, power source for and placement of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms is not determined as part of this inspection. Upon taking occupancy, proper operating and placement of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms should be verified and batteries should be changed. These devices have a limited lifespan and should be replaced every 10 years. The inspector attempts to locate and evaluate all main and sub-panels. However, panels are often concealed. If panels are found after the inspection, a qualified electrician should evaluate and repair if necessary. The inspector attempts to determine the overall electrical service size, but such estimates are not guaranteed because the overall capacity may be diminished by lesser-rated components in the system. Any repairs recommended should be made by a licensed electrician.</div>

Regardless of the type, recommend checking filters monthly in the future and replacing or cleaning them as necessary. How frequently they need replacing or cleaning depends on the type and quality of the filter, how the system is configured (e.g. always on vs. "Auto"), and on environmental factors (e.g. pets, smoking, frequency of house cleaning, number of occupants, the season).

<b>37) </b><img src="https://www.reporthost.com/_icons/ic0010.gif" style="margin:0 1px;" alt="">A whole house fan was installed. These fans provide cooling for interior spaces by blowing hot interior air up into the attic and out through attic vents, and by drawing cooler air in from the outside through open windows. They are intented to operate only when the outside temperature is cooler than inside. Multiple windows should be opened to equal or exceed 3 times the area of the fan opening. If air conditioning is installed it should not be operated while the whole house fan is operated. These fans do not dehumidify. They may be noisy during operation.<br><br>In some cases, additional attic venting is required for whole house fans to allow blown air to exit the attic. Attic vents should be kept clear at all times. Inadequate attic venting may result in attic air blowing through ceiling penetrations such as lights, or down through wall framing. It's beyond the scope of a home inspection to determine if attic venting is adequate. If concernced, review the fan's documentation and/or consult with a qualified contractor.<br><br>Be aware of safety issues related to whole house fans. Injury can occur if people come in contact with fan blades or belts. Louvers should always be open and the area above the fan should be unobstructed during operation, otherwise the fan may overheat and pose a fire hazard. Items should never be stored on top of the fan. Negative interior air pressure can cause gas-fired appliances such as water heaters and clothes dryers to backdraft, or cause flame rollout or pilot lights to blow out. Carbon monoxide and/or fire hazards may result. Children should never be allowed to operate whole house fans.<br><br>Whole house fans should be shut down during cooler months when not needed. This includes installing an insulated cover over the fan and turning power off to the the fan.<br><br>The client should be aware that some routine maintenance is required for whole house fans such as lubrication, and tightening or replacing belts cleaning. Consult with a heating and cooling specialist on this. Note also that motors and other components have a limited lifespan.<br><br>For more information visit:<br><a href="https://www.reporthost.com/?WHFAN" target="_blank" class="forceWrap">https://www.reporthost.com/?WHFAN</a>
