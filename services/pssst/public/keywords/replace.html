  This replaces annotated passwords within a given file.
  <br><br>
  For example...
  If the file ./prop.txt contains a line "dbPass=_{password}_"
  <br>
  and
  <br>
  Within collection myApp it has the <b>key-value</b> password=12345.
  <br>
  Then after running...
  <br>
  sudo confidentalInfo.sh replace myApp password ./prop.txt
  <br>
  That line would be changed to "dbPass=12345".
