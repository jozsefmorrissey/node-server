I went on a camping trip with my brothers family. One early morning  I awoke
because my nephew had roled over and pinned me in the corner of a fold out bed.
I poked him, his eyes opened and locked with mine as I cower in the only space i had left.
We both immediatly sarted laughing. By now my brother and his wife were up.
My brother seemed to be getting dressed at the head of the camper, his wife was
making coffee. There daughter was surely awakened by the commotion but appeared
to still be sleeping. I felt like i had gotten very little sleep but I stumbled
out of bed mandy went in the bathroom and the camper began to shake.The shaking
persisted for several seconds.

Me: "what is going on in here?"

The shaking became violent and lights started flikering...

Me: "what the fuck is happening?"
Even: "There's somthing wrong."

I opened the door and felt the wind rush by my face while whiping the door out
of my hand.

Me: "The trailer is moving." Said Calmly
Even: "What?"
Me: "The trailer is moving" Shouted loudly with a sence of urgency.

The trailer was rolling backward at around 30 mph.
The sun hadnt come up yet and the field was only moon lit.
As Evan walked to the door. I thought is there any way to stop the trailer... No.
We need to get off before it hits somthing. But I couldent see clearly enought
to find a safe spot to jump. I looked to the rear... we were barreling towards
a hundred foot cliff. I could see a hazy out line of a large ocean liner pushing
waves on what appeared to be a collision corse for the cliff where we were going
to fall of... Dont think about that. I still have barely enough time to
jump on land. I would likely be the only survivor. Fuck, this is going to suck.
Even is almost to the door now.
I decide to yell, jump now water, and throw evan out and jump after him hopefully
we can save the others in the water, I take a deep breath and yell

"JU!"

My eyes open and I shut down my scream.... It was all a dream.
